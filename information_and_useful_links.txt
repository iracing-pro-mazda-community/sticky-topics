[color=orange][size=16][b]B. Race Info[/b][/size][/color]
In the weekly threads  [color=green](***201x Season x Week xx - Name Circuit**)[/color] you will find all the information you need about that particulair week, like hotlaps (video and TT best laps), tutorials, race info, weather conditions, comparing times, setup share and many more. To watch the tutorials and the hotlaps is a good way to learn from the quickest drivers in this series.

[u]General information [/u]
[b]Race Length -[/b] 26 to 38 minutes
[b]Starts -[/b] both Standing ( Road ) and Rolling ( Oval )
[b]Tracks -[/b] we race on majority Road tracks but have at least 1 Oval track
[b]Splits -[/b] Race will split when there are more then 24
[b]Qualifying - [/b] Attached to race Session and is max 2 laps within a 7 minute window
[b]Official Races -[/b] 6 drivers are the minimum for a race to be Official
[b]Fuel - [/b]Fuel Tank is limited to 25% ( 4.75 gallons / 18 litres )


[color=orange][size=16][b]C.Championship & Divisions[/b][/size][/color]
Each standard Race series will be divided into 10 competition divisions, grouping drivers of similar skill level in competition for the remainder of the season. Any standard series open to holders of rookie competition licenses shall include an eleventh division for any rookie license holders participating in that series.

At the beginning of each season, the iRacing.com system will  automatically partition drivers [b]into 10 (or 11 when appropriate) [/b]competition divisions based on the previous s[b]eason ending iRatings[/b].

Assignment to a division is made based on your rating (iRating for race, and ttRating for time trial). The range of rating points for each division are fixed. [b]The lowest rating[/b] to get [b]into divisions from 1 to 10 [/b]are as follows:
[color=blue]Race: 0, 500, 720, 927, 1130, 1278, 1440, 1713, 2283, 3500 [/color]
[color=green]Time Trial: 0, 950, 1120, 1203, 1244, 1278, 1314, 1358, 1483, 1800[/color]

[color=orange][size=16][b]D.Pitstops & Useful Keys[/b][/size][/color]

[color=orange][b]D.1 Pitstops[/b][/color]
Pro Mazda has 19 gallons / 72 litres of fuel but for this season has 25% restriction which gives max fuel of 4.75 gallons / 18 litres for official sessions only. This will be enough for most races like Bathurst where 16 laps will use a bit over 4 gallons ( 4 gallons will get approx 14.9 laps which is roughly .273 gallons per lap ) .

[color=orange][b]D.2 Useful Keys & Commands[/b][/color]
Some circuits will require a pit stop for fuel and the easiest way is [b]to clear all options[/b] for your fuel stop ( new tyres wont have much effect on the length of races we do but will increase your pit time) Macro's are the easiest way to do this .

Step 1. Command:  [b]#clear fuel 1g$ [/b]= No tires or windshield, just 1 gallon (splash) of fuel.

Step 2. Now you will only need one macro and bind that to a button on your steering wheel or whatever. So in Options just add #clear fuel 1g$ as per picture [/b]

[color=darkblue]Or[/color]

You can [b]clear all options[/b] by changing a command in [b]app.ini[/b] file.

Step 1. This app.ini file is at your [b]iRacing folder[/b] on your computer.
Step 2. Find: [b][Pit Service][/b]
Step 3. Change [b]AutoResetPitbox[/b] to [b]0[/b]

[color=orange][size=16][b]B. SOF-races [/b][/size][/color]
SOF means = strength of field. More people with high rating in a split means more points for championships. We have some time schedules where we meet each other to race together. Last seasons these days and times were the best times to race with each other. It can change every season. So we always keep an eye on this.

[color=orange][size=16][b]A. Setup Guide[/b][/size][/color]
Below some information about how to make setups.

[b][color=orange]A.1 iRacing Setups[/color][/b]
iRacing provides [b]four[/b] setups for Pro Mazda verhicle:
[list]baseline[/list]
[list]high downforce[/list]
[list]medium downforce[/list]
[list]low downforce[/list]

Your setup choice depends the track you are racing. [b]High downforce[/b]  is for tracks with short straight and a bunch of corners (Laguna Seca, Brands Hatch, Hungaoring, Monaco). [b]Medium downforce[/b] can be used for tracks with a few long straights, but also wih fast and slow corners (Suzuka, Bathurst). [b]Low downforce[/b] would be working for tracks with very long straights and less corners. (Le Mans, Monza).
